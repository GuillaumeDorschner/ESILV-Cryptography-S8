# Cryptography Project

Welcome to the Cryptography Project by Guillaume Dorschner and Jules Deleuse. Divided into two main parts, this project delves into cryptographic principles and their application in securing user data. Below, you'll find a brief introduction to each part of the project, along with links for detailed information.

## Part 1: Password Storage

The first section focuses on the secure storage of passwords, a crucial component of protecting user credentials in any application. The aim is to implement robust security practices, considering various attack scenarios discussed.

## Part 2: Password-Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE)

The second part discusses Password-Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE), a method for securely authenticating users without transmitting passwords in plaintext, even without an encrypted channel. This section is vital for understanding how to secure communication between a client and a server without compromising user secrets.
